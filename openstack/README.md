## nova-ephemeral.py
This scripts allows you to split ephemeral storage (local SSD for fast IO) and persistent storage with Ceph RBD as the backer. This is done using host aggregates and setting metadata extras for the given flavors of images. It uses python-novaclient instead of calling the nova or openstack cli directly so that it can have better control over the process. The script can be ran without anything like Ansible, Chef or Puppet but it can be easily used by each. If being used by something like Chef then you can create a recipe that calls the script and instead of passing a list of hosts-ephemeral or hosts-persistent just simply assign the current host with something like --host-ephemeral=#{node['hostname']} as one of the parameters being passed in.
